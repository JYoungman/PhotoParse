# PhotoParse
Utility for easily sorting pictures into folders by date.

When given a folder containing images with names of the appropriate format, and a writable destination folder, this program will generate subfolders in the destination folder, each containing copies of the photos in the source folder taken on the date associated with that subfolder.

Works with photos using the file naming convention of the Samsung Galaxy S10's camera app. That is, yyyymmdd_[additionalnumbers].jpg. Will likely work with any file names that begin with a yyyymmdd_ prefix, but this is untested as of this writing.

Subfolders name format is yyyy-mm-dd.
